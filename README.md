# Rice-Leaf-Prediction
# ● This dataset contains 119 jpg images of disease-infected rice leaves. The images are grouped into 3 classes based on the type of disease. There are 40 images in each class.
# ● Classes
1. Leaf smut
2. Brown spot
3. Bacterial leaf blight
# ● AIM
 Create a model which can classify the three major attacking diseases of rice plants like leaf smut, bacterial blight and brown spot.
# ● conclusion
In our project, we successfully developed a deep learning model that accurately predicts rice leaf diseases, marking a significant achievement in agricultural technology. This model has proven to be highly effective, consistently making correct predictions during testing. Its practical application is particularly beneficial for farmers, as it greatly aids in the early identification of diseases in rice crops.
